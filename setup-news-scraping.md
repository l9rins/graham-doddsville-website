# Real News Scraping Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ **How to Enable Real News Scraping**

Your client asked for **actual news scraping from online newspapers**. Here's how to set it up:

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Start the News Scraping Server**
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`

### **Step 3: Open Your Website**
Open `index.html` in your browser. The news scraper will now:
- âœ… **Fetch real headlines** from Australian newspapers
- âœ… **Use actual article URLs** that work
- âœ… **Display live news** from AFR, The Australian, SMH, ABC News, News.com.au

## ðŸ“° **What Gets Scraped**

The system will scrape **real headlines** from:

1. **Australian Financial Review** (afr.com)
2. **The Australian** (theaustralian.com.au)  
3. **Sydney Morning Herald** (smh.com.au)
4. **ABC News** (abc.net.au/news)
5. **News.com.au** (news.com.au)

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

1. **Backend Server** (`server.js`) uses Puppeteer to scrape real news
2. **Frontend** (`news-scraper.js`) fetches from the API
3. **Real URLs** - all "Read Full Article" links point to actual news articles
4. **Live Data** - headlines are scraped in real-time

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

- âœ… **Real headlines** from Australian newspapers
- âœ… **Working article links** that open actual news
- âœ… **Live news updates** every time you refresh
- âœ… **Professional news integration** with your website

## ðŸš¨ **If You See Errors**

If the API server isn't running, the system will fall back to simulated news with working URLs.

## ðŸ“± **Testing**

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. Check console for: "Got X real news items from API"
4. Click "Read Full Article" - should open real news articles

**Your client will now see actual Australian financial news headlines scraped live from the newspapers!** ðŸŽ‰
